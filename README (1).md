## RNN Perfomance Analysis in Machine Translation

Our project explores the application and comparative performance of different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures - Simple RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - in the field of machine translation. The focus is on evaluating how these models translate from English to French, assessed through accuracy and BLEU scores. The findings highlight LSTM as the most effective model, with the highest accuracy and BLEU scores, challenging initial expectations about the capabilities of these neural network architectures.
